GSM Network Security Analysis
An ongoing research project exploring the architecture, security vulnerabilities, and modern-day implications of the GSM (2G) standard.

About The Project
This repository contains the research, findings, and analysis related to the security of the Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM). While many parts of the world have moved on to 4G and 5G, the legacy of 2G and the requirement for backward compatibility in modern devices create a persistent and often overlooked attack surface.

This project aims to deconstruct the foundational flaws within the GSM standard and demonstrate why these decades-old vulnerabilities still pose a relevant threat to user privacy and security today.

Key Research Areas
Our analysis is currently focused on a cascade of foundational issues within the GSM protocol stack:

Weak by Design (A5/1 & COMP128): We are exploring how the "strong" A5/1 encryption algorithm was fundamentally crippled from its inception by the flawed and deliberately weakened COMP128 key generation algorithm. This appears to have reduced the effective key strength by a factor of 1024, making the cipher significantly easier to crack.

One-Way Trust (Authentication Flaw): A major area of investigation is GSM's lack of mutual authentication. A mobile device was required to prove its identity to the network, but the network was never required to prove its identity back. This oversight is the root cause of one of the most significant attack vectors.

IMSI Catchers ("False Base Stations"): We are confirming how the one-way trust model directly enables the infamous IMSI Catcher attack. This research demonstrates how these attacks remain a viable threat, allowing adversaries to intercept communications by forcing devices to connect to rogue towers and downgrade their encryption.

Why This Research Matters
Modern smartphones are still designed to be backward-compatible with 2G networks to ensure connectivity in all areas. A key part of this project is demonstrating how an attacker can exploit this by jamming 4G/5G signals, forcing a device to "downgrade" to the insecure GSM standard.

This work reinforces a crucial lesson: the security of our modern, complex systems is often only as strong as their weakest, oldest link.

Project Status
This is an active and ongoing research project. Findings and conclusions will be updated as the analysis develops.

Tools & Technologies
This research leverages a combination of affordable hardware and open-source software:

Software-Defined Radio (SDR): For capturing raw RF signals.

GR-GSM: For demodulating and decoding GSM communications.

Wireshark: For protocol analysis of the decoded data.
